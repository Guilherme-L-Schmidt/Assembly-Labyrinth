3D rendering engine developed in assembly to run in the ICMC processor, wich currently renders a labyrinth game.

The assembler and simulator fork I am currently using can be found [here](https://github.com/Guilherme-L-Schmidt/Processador-ICMC/tree/master/Simulator_Source), the correct assembler is found in the `NovoMontadorLinux/montadorLinux` folder, and the simulator in the `Simulator_Source` folder.

Both are modified to work correctly with negative numbers and to implement the NEG instruction.

`montador` is the assembler and `sim` is the simulator.
