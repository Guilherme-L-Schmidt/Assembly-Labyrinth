3D rendering engine developed in assembly to run in the ICMC processor.
The assembler and simulator fork I am currently using can be found [here](https://github.com/Guilherme-L-Schmidt/Processador-ICMC/tree/master/Simulator_Source).

It uses the Bresenham's line algorithm to draw pixels on screen using only integers.

`montador` is the assembler and `simulador` is the simulator.
